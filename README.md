# UART-Design
UART Design and Implementation on BASYS 3 Board Using SystemVerilog
Run Project_stage_2, CS223_Project was the first version but its modules are imported in stage 2. The constraints file is attached. Generate bitstream and load the bitstream into two BASYS 3 boards, and connect the two boards via jumper cables, keeping in mind the connection ports specified in the constraints file. You can connect a board to itself as well.
